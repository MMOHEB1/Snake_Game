# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using PyCharm. The game is built using Pygame, a popular library for game development in Python.

## How to Play
Objective: Control the snake to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or itself.

Controls: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to change the snake's direction.

Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

Scoring: Each time the snake eats food, its length increases, and the score increments.

## Features
Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously in the direction it's facing until the player changes its direction.

Food Generation: Food pellets appear randomly on the screen for the snake to eat.

Score Tracking: Keep track of the player's score as they eat more food.

Game Over Detection: Detect collisions with walls or the snake's body to end the game.

Restart Option: Allow players to restart the game after it ends.
